-------
The template and the helper script are released under the GNU GPLv3

You must include this file when distributing this Zabbix template.

Installation
------------
Please change the SNMP Community string in the Perl helper script,
if it is not set to "public" in your Equallogic systems.

Import the XML file into Zabbix (under Configuration -> Templates).

The SNMP Community string for the template can be set in the template
configuration itself, under Macros. By default this is set to: "public".

Copy the Perl helper script to the ExternalScripts directory
(see /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf) and make sure it is executable
by running: chmod a+rx /path/to/discover_eqlvolumes.pl

Run the following command on the console:
snmpwalk -v2c -c <COMMUNITY-STRING> <EQL-IP> .1.3.6.1.4.1.12740.2.1.1.1.9.1
for example:
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 123.456.798.1 .1.3.6.1.4.1.12740.2.1.1.1.9.1
you will get something like that:
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.12740.2.1.1.1.9.1.1234567890 = STRING: "Foo"
now create a macro on the Host
{EQL_ID} -> 1234567890
{EQL_NAME} -> foo

we need that because zabbix has no nested LLD at the moment, please vote for it https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBXNEXT-1527
